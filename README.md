## Project description

Head trauma is a critical medical condition with potentially severe consequences, thus requiring timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Medical imaging, including computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a key role in diagnosing head trauma as it provides detailed visualizations of internal brain structures. However, manual interpretation of these images is time-consuming and subject to human error. Utilizing deep learning techniques for image classification holds great potential in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the assessment of head trauma cases.

We aim to develop a deep learning model to diagnose traumatic brain injuries, using a dataset of CT scans, MRI scans, and X-rays of patients with head trauma. We will then evaluate the trained deep learning model using a separate test dataset containing labeled medical images in order to assess the models’ accuracy and sensitivity. 

The architecture of this network is image classification, with the parameter choices being normal brain scans and brain scans with traumatic brain injuries (TBI). To train the network, the datasets that we will be utilizing will contain X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs in order to assess patient data. Various datasets we plan to use or look at are The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) Database, The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pediatric Bone Age Challenge Dataset, The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), The Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) Challenge Dataset, and Kaggle Datasets.
